# 🧵 TabFabric – Organize Chrome Tabs Like a Pro

**TabFabric** is a productivity-focused browser extension that helps you structure your browsing experience using Chrome's native tab grouping features. Assign colors, set custom group names, and manage your workspace with clarity.

## 💭 Why I end up making this ?
While researching a feature I needed to develop, I found myself buried under a cluttered mess of browser tabs. Some tabs were useful, others weren’t — but they all blended together in a chaotic sea of titles and favicons. This made it difficult to focus, stay organized, or revisit key resources.

That’s when I realized**💡** : **there was no existing Chrome extension that solved this tab clutter problem in a simple, customizable way**.

So, I created **TabFabric** — a lightweight, intuitive browser extension designed to bring structure to your tab chaos. It allows you to group tabs using Chrome’s native tab grouping features, but with more control:  
- Assign custom names to tab groups  
- Apply meaningful colors for visual separation
- Instant toast on applying the changes
- Manage and reorganize your tab workspace effortlessly

### Still thinking about the name given to the extension ❔ : Tab + fabric (a cloth for the tab to identify ezsily.)

Since using TabFabric, my workflow has become noticeably more focused and productive. It helps you think in *clusters* rather than tabs — giving every task its space.
